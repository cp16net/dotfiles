# notes

I've been using [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/) for a few months and its been pretty nice. Its pretty easy to setup and i've been using the develop branch instead of just the master branch.

## Quick Install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d && git checkout develop
```
